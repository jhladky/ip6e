The Plan

1. Develop interface with ATMega chip
2. Develop test harness for Layers 3-4 of the stack
3. Develop Layers 3-4
4. Reintegrate Layers-3-4 code with interface to chip code
5. Combine everything into ip6e library

Fall Quarter: Steps 2-4
Winter Quarter: Steps 1 & 5

* We need to write the functions that process the bits and functions that test that processing
* Try to look at fishnet for inspiration but don't copy it
* Remember we are conforming to the IPv6 standard and we are focusing in embedded
* Keep it in C, keep it fast, design the test harness to the code can be optimized.
* Testing is absolutely crucial here, it's going to be extremely difficult to test on the ATMega

Chip Functions
==============
* L2_rx
* L2_tx

Testable Functions
==================
* L3_rx
* L3_tx
